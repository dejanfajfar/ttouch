> touch with templates

## Introduction

One of my most used tools in a shell is the humble ```touch```. It is great but I always missed some things:

* The ability to create files using templates
* No native touch on windows...the console is not so great ether.

I must confess that the later is getting better, but still

To try and _fix_ this I give you ```ttouch```

## Installation

Because of my environment the 

```bash
$ npm install -g ttouch
```

## Usage

```bash
$ ttouch [filename] (options)
```
